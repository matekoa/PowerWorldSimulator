# PowerWorldSimulator

To design a power system project by performing power system
analysis. Power flow, balanced fault calculations and PowerWorld Simulations are performed to ensure that the power
system, together with its component parts, is appropriately
configured to function as expected.
We were able to create various data tables by simulating the 7
Bus power system with PowerWorld simulation and carrying
out several procedures related to power flow and fault analysis
concepts. The simulation allowed us to determine the amount
of generating capacity needed to fulfil system demand as well
as how to better account for unexpected changes in system
load, voltage magnitudes, and MVA limitations.
The design is built to ensure that the generator supplies the
load demand while also making sure that the transformers and
transmission lines are within their rated MVA limits and voltage magnitudes.
